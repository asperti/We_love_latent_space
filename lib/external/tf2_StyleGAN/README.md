# StyleGAN Tensorflow 2.0
This is an unofficial TensorFlow 2.0 implementation of the paper with full compatibility with the orignal code:

> **A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks**<br>
> Tero Karras (NVIDIA), Samuli Laine (NVIDIA), Timo Aila (NVIDIA)<br>
> http://stylegan.xyz/paper

Most of the code is just a translation of the [offical repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan).

# Notebook example
You can see how to load the model and generate samples in this [notebook](stylegan.ipynb).

# Goal
Training the model is not yet well supproted (might come later in the future). The main goal of this repo is to quickly load up StyleGAN and experiment with a pretrained model.
